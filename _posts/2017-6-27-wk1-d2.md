I believe today was a more typical day at Metis. It all started with a "pair problem" exercise. A pair problem is the one you work on in... pairs! Every day you are assigned a new classmate to work with during this time. The work involves solving some problem using Python and submitting it to our special #pairs channel in Slack. My partner and I were pretty quick about it and managed to submit it first (Not that anybody is counting... :smirk: But seriously, it wasn't graded. :laughing:). After every pair of students submitted their answers, we then took a look at various different ways students attempted solving the problem. As they say, there are many ways to skin the cat, which especially applies to coding.  

Next topic revolved around complexity of our programs, meaning how we determine run times and which programs are faster/slower than others. Having looked at complexity topic before, this was helpful, nonetheless as I am getting more and more intuition about it.  

Visualization section of today involved various ways to visualize data using Matplotlib, Pandas, and Seaborn. There are many options and flavors, but I think (and our instructor concurs), Seaborn is the most presentable. Check it out, you may enjoy it, too.  

After a 1 hour long lunch we had a nice in depth discussion on using Git and GitHub for versioning control. Apparently, there is much more to Git than `git pull/push/commit/add`. :smiley: I still need to practice using it in order to be more comfortable, so when I got home, I [watched](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqmSzXDrJBk) a [couple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a2x1iJFJWc) of [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTE2Fn_sCZs) [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iuqXh0oojo) on the subject. I think I will get better the more I use it.  

The conclusion of the day was continuing to work on our very first project in groups of 4. At the end of this week we will have to present our findings. We only have 2 more days to work on this, so it will be interesting...
